<!--We start with an array called animals that has four animals: "Cat", "Fish", "Lemur", and "Komodo Dragon".
We go through each animal in the array one by one.
For each animal, we add "Awesome " in front of its name.
After we're done, the array animals will have each animal name with "Awesome " added to it.
Finally, we print out the modified array to see the changes.-->
