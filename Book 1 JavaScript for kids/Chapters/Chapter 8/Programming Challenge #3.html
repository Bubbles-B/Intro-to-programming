<!--The HTML structure includes a title (Hangman!) and a <script> tag containing the JavaScript code.

Inside the <script> tag, several functions are defined:

pickWord: This function selects a random word from an array of predefined words.
setupAnswerArray: This function creates an array filled with underscores (_) representing each letter of the chosen word.
showPlayerProgress: This function displays the current state of the word to the player.
getGuess: This function prompts the player to enter a letter guess.
updateGameState: This function updates the answer array based on the player's guess.
showAnswerAndCongratulatePlayer: This function displays the final result to the player, showing the complete word and congratulating 
them on guessing it correctly.
The script initializes the game by:

Calling pickWord to select a random word.
Calling setupAnswerArray to create an answer array filled with underscores representing each letter of the word.
Initializing remainingLetters with the length of the word.
It then enters a loop where:

It shows the current progress to the player.
It prompts the player to enter a letter guess.
It updates the game state based on the player's guess.
It checks if the game should continue based on the number of remaining letters and the player's input.
Finally, when the game loop ends (either by guessing the word or canceling), it calls showAnswerAndCongratulatePlayer 
to display the final result to the player.-->
